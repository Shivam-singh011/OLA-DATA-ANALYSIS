# OLA-DATA-ANALYSIS
This project demonstrates data analysis on a dataset of 100,000 records using MySQL, Excel, and Power BI. It includes data cleaning, transformation, and visualization to uncover insights and trends. The workflow integrates SQL for data management, Excel for preprocessing, and Power BI for interactive dashboards and reports.


# Data Analysis Project (100,000 Records)

## Overview
This project demonstrates a complete data analysis workflow performed on a dataset of 100,000 records. The analysis combines **MySQL**, **Excel**, and **Power BI** to deliver data cleaning, transformation, validation, and visualization. The final output includes interactive dashboards designed to uncover meaningful trends and insights that support data-driven decision-making.

## Tools & Technologies
- **MySQL**: For structured data storage, querying, and management  
- **Excel**: For preprocessing, validation, and exploratory analysis  
- **Power BI**: For building interactive dashboards and reports  

## Key Features
- Cleaned and transformed raw data for analysis  
- Integrated SQL queries to extract and manipulate datasets  
- Validated and summarized data using Excel functions and pivot tables  
- Visualized insights through Power BI dashboards with filters and drill-down features  
- Highlighted key trends, correlations, and performance metrics  

## Project Workflow
1. Data Import and Management in MySQL  
2. Preprocessing and Quality Checks in Excel  
3. Visualization and Dashboard Creation in Power BI  

## Results
The project delivers meaningful insights into the dataset, providing:
- Identification of patterns and correlations  
- Performance metrics visualization  
- Interactive reporting for deeper exploration  

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository  
2. Access SQL scripts in the `sql/` folder for database setup and queries  
3. Open Excel files in the `excel/` folder for preprocessing  
4. Load the Power BI file (`.pbix`) to explore dashboards
